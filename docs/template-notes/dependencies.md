# Dependencies

## Lockfile

The `yarn.lock` file is deliberately not set up on this template, otherwise vulnerabilities come up almost weekly on Snyk and GitHub.

But for your own project, it is a good idea to add that file to version control.


## Upgrading

Upgrade to the latest packages with:

```sh
$ yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest react-scripts@latest web-vitals@latest
